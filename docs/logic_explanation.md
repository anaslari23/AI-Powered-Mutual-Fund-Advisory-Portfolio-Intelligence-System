# Logic Explanation

## Future Value (FV)
The formula used to calculate inflation-adjusted cost:
`FV = PV × (1 + inflation)^years`

## SIP Calculation
To calculate the future value of a Systematic Investment Plan:
`FV = P × [((1+r)^n - 1) / r] × (1+r)`

This is used universally for calculating wealth accumulation given a monthly investable amount. We reverse this algebraically to find the required SIP given a target Future Corpus.

## Projections
Projecting wealth over time calculates monthly accumulated interest based on compounding `(annual_rate / 12)`.
